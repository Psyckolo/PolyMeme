Polymeme – AI Prediction Markets

What is Polymeme?

Polymeme is a prediction market platform where you bet against an AI oracle. Every few hours, our AI analyzes crypto markets and makes bold predictions about token prices and NFT floor values.
Your job? Decide if the AI is right or wrong.

Polymeme is a decentralized betting platform where an AI Oracle predicts crypto markets. You bet whether the AI is right or wrong, and winners share the pot.

How It Works

The AI Makes a Prediction – Our AI oracle analyzes market data and predicts whether an asset will go UP or DOWN in the next 24 hours.

You Take a Side – Think the AI nailed it? Bet “AI RIGHT”. Think it’s wrong? Bet “AI WRONG”.

Wait for Settlement – After 24 hours, we check the actual price movement.

Winners Take the Pool – All winning bettors share the total pool proportionally. The more you bet, the bigger your share.

How It Works (Detailed)
Market Cycle
CREATION          LOCK              SETTLEMENT
    |               |                   |
    |--- BETTING ---|--- WAITING -------|
    |   (2 hours)   |   (22 hours)      |
    v               v                   v
  T+0h            T+2h               T+24h


Creation (T+0h) – The AI analyzes the market and creates a prediction

Betting Open (0–2h) – You can place bets for 2 hours

Lock (T+2h) – Bets are locked; no more entries

Settlement (T+24h) – Final price is compared to initial price → winners determined

Prediction Frequency

1 new market every 4 hours

6 markets per day (0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h)

Balanced mix: 50% crypto tokens / 50% NFTs

Game Modes
Simulated Mode (Virtual USDC)

No real money

Start with 5000 virtual USDC

Perfect for learning

No wallet required

Mainnet Mode (Real SOL)

Bet using SOL on Solana

Requires Phantom wallet

Every bet is a blockchain transaction

You sign with your wallet to confirm

Claiming Rewards

Wait for the market to settle (after 24h)

Go to Dashboard → Positions

Click Claim on winning bets

Rewards are credited depending on the mode:

Simulated → Your USDC balance increases

Mainnet → SOL sent to your Phantom wallet

Payout Calculation (Pari-mutuel)

Winners share 100% of the total pool, proportional to their stake.

Example:

AI RIGHT pool: 1000 USDC

AI WRONG pool: 500 USDC

AI was correct → AI RIGHT wins

You bet 100 USDC (10% of winning pool)

You receive 10% × 1500 = 150 USDC
