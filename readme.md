## What is Polymeme?

Polymeme is a prediction market platform where you bet against an AI oracle. Every few hours, our AI analyzes crypto markets and makes bold predictions about token prices and NFT floor values. Your job? Decide if the AI is right or wrong.

## How It Works

1. **The AI Makes a Prediction** - Our AI oracle analyzes market data and predicts whether an asset will go UP or DOWN in the next 24 hours.

2. **You Take a Side** - Think the AI nailed it? Bet "AI RIGHT". Think it's wrong? Bet "AI WRONG".

3. **Wait for Settlement** - After 24 hours, we check the actual price movement and determine the winner.

4. **Winners Take the Pool** - All winning bettors share the total pool proportionally. The more you bet, the bigger your share.

## Two Ways to Play

**Simulated Mode** - Practice with virtual USDC. No real money, no risk. Perfect for learning the ropes.

**Mainnet Mode** - Bet with real SOL through your Phantom wallet. Real stakes, real rewards.

## What Can You Bet On?

- **Tokens**: BONK, PEPE, WIF, DOGE and more popular crypto tokens
- **NFT Collections**: Pudgy Penguins, Milady, Captainz and other blue-chip NFTs
